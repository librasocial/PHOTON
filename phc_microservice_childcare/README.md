# Overview üìù

Infants that are part of the PNC (Post Natal Care) service, are registered for immunizations with a schedule. This service intents to capture the registration details and uses that to recommend a immunization schedule. 

As part of the registration, the infant is registered in the RCH portal and a serial number is procured. Along the same lines, an HealthId is also generated and the same is updated in the respective services. 

Finally, there is a strong link with EMR specific service called ImmunizationRecomendation and Immunization to track the immunization.
