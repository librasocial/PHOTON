# Overview üìù

In the domain of information security, access control (AC) is the selective restriction of access to a resource, while access management or the access control management describes the policies. The act of accessing may mean reading, creating, or updating. Permission to access a resource is called authorization. 

Access control can be defined using many models - RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control). The difference between them is outside the scope of this document. 

Given a policy that has many rules of access to resources, this service provides an implementation of the rule for authorization.
