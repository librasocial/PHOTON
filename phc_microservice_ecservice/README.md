# Overview üìù

The Eligible couple service starts with a registration handled by ECRegistration service and continues into this service where a Birth Control or a Pre-Conception types of service are handled. 

Specifically, the same couple may go through a birth control for a period of time and then move to pre-conception. This service has the capability to record both types.
