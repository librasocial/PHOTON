# Overview üìù

An organization or an organization unit, is an entity‚Äîsuch as a Primary Health Center, an institution, or an association like the Gram Panchayat ‚Äî comprising one or more people and having a particular purpose. 

We many extend this to represent the whole country, states within the country, districts, taluks etc as organizations. As it is evident, Organizations comprise of sub organizations and more often than not there may be a hierarchy of sub organizations. The other aspect are members of the organizations.  While we call members of country, state etc as citizens, this is a semantic that we will evolve as roles that members play in the organization.
