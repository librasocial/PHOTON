# Overview üìù

Pharmacy Orders are those Drugs prescribed by the medical officer in the PHC / Sub Center or drugs prescribed by any external doctor. There is an automatic creation of the Pharmacy order if the prescription is created within the PHC. 

On the other hand, the Pharmacist creates the order manually if there is a walk-in. The walk-in can be sub divided into 2 scenarios - a fresh walk-in order or an incomplete or not completely fulfilled orders. For e.g. there might be scenario where a drug‚Äôs stock might be lesser than the required quantity. So the Patient may walk-in later to complete it.
