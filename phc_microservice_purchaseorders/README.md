# Overview üìù

The Pharmacy in the PHC, replenishes the stocks by raising a Purchase Order or an Indent.  A purchase order (PO) is a official request issued by the PHC to a Supplier (District or Taluk Head Office or Drug Warehouse) indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for products. Indent on the other hand is a purchase order often placed under pre-specified conditions.
