# Overview 📝

The Covid surveillance is performed to catalog the following:

- Whether the citizen has been administered the vaccination for Covid
- If the citizen is vaccinated what type of vaccine
  - How many doses administered

At the end of each lab report, the test result is updated on the PrimaryHealthCare Service with the appropriate status.
